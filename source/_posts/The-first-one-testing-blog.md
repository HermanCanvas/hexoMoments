这一年似乎什么都变了，又似乎什么都没变。

重新开始写博客，一切似乎循环往复，有些口号似的话对于中年人来说更具现实意义，积极面对生活中的无能为力，虽不能及，心向往之，尽力为之，做好身边的小事，忙碌却不迷失方向，享受却不废弛理想，积极与人交流，融入感兴趣的集体圈子，放下面子，没有人有兴趣对你有什么想法，都是自己给套的枷锁罢了，接纳宽容别人，给别人留有空间，自己才能进退有余。

Starting to write a blog again, everything seems to be going in circles. Some slogans-like words hold more practical significance for middle-aged individuals. Facing the helplessness in life with a positive attitude, though unable to achieve everything, we yearn for it in our hearts and strive to do our best. Taking care of the small things around us keeps us busy without losing our direction, enjoying ourselves without abandoning our ideals. Actively engaging in communication with others, integrating into circles of interest, setting aside our egos—no one is interested in what others think of us, it's just self-imposed shackles. Accepting and tolerating others, leaving room for them, enables us to have a balanced approach in our own actions.
